# Statistical-Rethinking-PyMC4-notes

This project was created to learn Bayesian statistics principles using the PyMC4 package. To do this, I created lecture notes based on second edition of Richard McElreathâ€™s (2020a) text, [Statistical rethinking: A Bayesian course with examples in R and Stan](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) and his [video lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdnMWdICdRs&list=PLDcUM9US4XdPz-KxHM4XHt7uUVGWWVSus) video lectures. 

All code is written in `.ipynb` notebooks and edited on Google Colab.

## Chapters

* `02_chapter.ipynb`

## References

* There are already implementations of lecture notes in both [PyMC3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc-resources/tree/main/Rethinking_2) and [PyMC4](https://github.com/kpjmcg/Statistical-Rethinking-2023-Python-Notes/tree/master). I have chosen to do my own implementation in the newest stable [PyMC version](https://www.pymc.io/blog/v4_announcement.html) in a similar matter as [Statistical rethinking with brms, ggplot2, and the tidyverse: Second edition](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/).
